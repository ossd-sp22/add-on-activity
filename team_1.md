# Part 3

1. README.MD is a handbook. It outlines how to install, set up, and run the project; what the general purpose of the project is; and any other salient details. If there are any other dependencies necessary for install, those are outline in README.MD.

2. LICENSE is necessary for a project to be open-source. Without a copyleft license, code is under the copyright of the author. As such, a license file is absolutely essential for a project to be considered open source. For a private repo no one else will ever see, it may not be necessary; however, for a group project, it absolutely is.

3. Contributing.md outlines how a new contributor can get involved in a project, what norms/practices they are expected to follow, and what kind of contributions are welcome.

4. Translating a text document like README.MD is a great way to get involved that requires no programming knowledge.

5. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md is, as the name implies, a code of acceptable and unacceptable conduct. The Code of Conduct outlines what kind of social interactions are acceptable in the project, and what kind of behavior is forbidden. It is absolutely essential for any group project; conflicts will show up, always, so it's good to make sure that there are clear rules in place describing what to do in the event of a conflict.

6. Personal attacks, derogatory language, unwelcome sexual attention/physical contact.

7. Open an issue. Other members of the project will try to solve the problem to the best of their ability.
