## What is the purpose of the README.md file? What kind of information should be included there?

The README.md gives a general description of the project including its purpose, its contents, and its usage. It then gives more specific instructions on how to use the files in the repo including further readings and actual implementation of the code across different browsers. It makes sense for this information to be included here. The README should give a general overview so that users know what they are working with. It should also demonstrate how to run the program and offer communication between the user and developer if there are any problems.

## What is the purpose of the LICENSE file? Does it need to be in a repository?

Outlines ownership of the content in the repository and the rules governing its use, editing, and sharing. The LICENSE file is a legal document per se, and much of the language used is to this very effect, especially sections 7 and 8 which deal with limitations of liability and litigation respectively.
The license (Mozilla Public License 2.0) is self-described as a “​​weak copyleft license,” which is a result of Mozilla Firefox’ open-source nature interacting with the nature of its management.

## What is the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file?

The CONTRIBUTING.md file outlines some general guidelines to help contributors write examples for the “webextensions-examples” repository. It also lists the types of contributions, such as writing a brand-new example, extending an existing example, fixing a bug, and contributing a translation for improving the repository.

## Describe one type of contribution to this repository that does not require writing any code.

Contributing a translation of a file does not require writing any code. This translation could be of the README (most likely to be read by the most number of people) or any other file.

## What is the purpose of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document?

The CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file redirects users to the latest version of the “​​Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines,” which outline community expectations with regard to the behavior of those wishing to contribute to Mozilla projects, whether by suggesting edits, fixing issues, or offering translations. They also outline what is not seen as acceptable by the community.

## Describe three types of behaviors that violate the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines.

- Personal attacks
- Disruptive behavior
- Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact
