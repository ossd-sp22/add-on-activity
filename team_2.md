1. The README.md file is usually the first thing that the user should read before going into the code. It gives information about what the code does, how to use it, or info about updates to the project.

2. The LICENSE file allows a user to access and potentially use and contribute to the piece of software or project. Without this file, the project is not publicly available to others to contribute to, as it is under the author's copyright. 

3. The CONTRIBUTING.md file gives potential project contributors instructions on how to contribute to the project. Additionally, it highlights how they can collaborate with other contributors and guidelines they are meant to follow.
