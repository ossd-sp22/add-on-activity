#### 2. What is the purpose of the LICENSE file? Does it need to be in a repository?

The license file within a project allows the original developer to express and define how the project can be used or modified, and what specific components of the project these actions can be done on. The license file needs to be within the repository since the licensing terms and conditions are directly referring to the content that is within the given repository.

#### 3. What is the purpose of the CONTRIBUTING.md file?
