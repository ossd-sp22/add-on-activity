## Part 3
1. The purpose of the README.md file is to serve as an introduction to the project. It does this by providing examples, a how-to use section, and installation instructions. It also gives instructions needed to handle any potential issues. 
2. The LICENSE file touches upon the permissions and limitations of how the code can be used, modified, and distributed. The LICENSE file does need to be in the repository if you want to allow other creators to use your code. If it's not in the repository, you are automatically protected by copyright laws.
3. The CONTRIBUTING.md file supplies guidelines on how to improve and modify the repository and gives examples on the format and style.
4. One contribution that does not require writing any code is contributing a translation of the README.md file in a new language.
5. The purpose of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md document is to provide guidelines on how to be a respectful contributor. It also provides a means to provide any improper behavior.
6. Three types of behaviors that violate the Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines are derogatory language, disruptive behavior, and unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact.
7. If a person runs into problems or has questions they should post a query on the add-ons discourse forum, email the dev-addons mailing list, or contact the add-ons team in the Add-ons room on Matrix.
